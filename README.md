# Greetings, visitor!

Computer Science student interested in everything related to **Data**, with a growing focus on **Data Engineering**.
I'm currently studying **Python** and working on projects that involve building **data structures** and **processing pipelines**, using libraries such as **pandas** and **NumPy**.
My next step is to develop my skills in **SQL**.
I also explore other areas of Computer Science as part of my degree.

Earlier, I created a few **Power BI dashboards**, which you can find [here](https://data-analytics-portfolio-rafael-nakayama.lovable.app/)
